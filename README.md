## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- background properties
- position layout

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<article class="music">
          <section class="music-bg">
            <img
              class="music-img"
              src="images/icon-music.svg"
              alt="music icon"
            />
            <p class="music-plan">Annual Plan <span>$59.99/year</span></p>
            <h3 class="music-link">
              <a href="#">Change</a>
            </h3>
          </section>
        </article>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  /* min-height: 100vh; */
  background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: contain;
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
}
```

### Continued development

i will focus on using flexbox layout in the future projects. These concepts am comfortable with and i found tit very useful .

i will focus on using relative units vh or vw it helps me to write short and clean code .

i will focus on specificity using class or id selectors .

i will focus on  using position layout .

i will focus on  using background properties .
